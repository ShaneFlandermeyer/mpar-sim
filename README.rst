Multi-function Phased Array Radar (MPAR) Simulator

Documentation: https://mpar-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Overview

The MPAR simulator is a python-based simulation tool that I developed as part of my Master's thesis, and am actively maintaining as I continue my Ph.D. research. The repo currently has many tools for radar scenario simulation and tracking.  

Most of the major features have integration tests in the ```test/``` subdirectory that show examples of how to use each class.

In the future, I would like to add some I/Q level simulation, probably GPU accelerated with Jax.
